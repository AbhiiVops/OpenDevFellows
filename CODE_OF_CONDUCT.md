# Code of Conduct

Our community is committed to providing a welcoming, safe, and inclusive space for all contributors, regardless of their background, identity, or experience level. To foster a positive and constructive environment, we expect everyone to follow the guidelines outlined below:

Be respectful: Treat everyone with respect, including those with different viewpoints or opinions. Avoid making personal attacks, engaging in name-calling, or using language that is offensive or discriminatory.

Be inclusive: We welcome people of all backgrounds and identities, and we strive to create a community where everyone feels valued and included. Avoid language or behavior that could be seen as exclusionary, and be mindful of how your actions and words might impact others.

Be collaborative: Our community thrives on collaboration and mutual support. Be willing to share knowledge, ask questions, and help others. Avoid engaging in behavior that is competitive or uncooperative.

Be constructive: We encourage constructive criticism and feedback, but we expect everyone to express themselves in a respectful and professional manner. Avoid using language or behavior that is hostile, aggressive, or confrontational.

Be accountable: If you make a mistake, take responsibility for your actions and work to make things right. If you witness someone else violating our code of conduct, report it to the appropriate person or group.

By following these guidelines, we can create a positive and productive community that benefits everyone involved. Thank you for your commitment to making our community a welcoming and inclusive space for all.
